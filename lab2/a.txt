    what is premptive?
    1. A process that is not allowed to continue its execution beyond a certain period of time,
    and then the CPU is given to another process. This is called preemption. In other
    words, when one process has completed its quantum or executed for a specified amount of time,
    it is said to be preempted by another process which gets control of the CPU next.
